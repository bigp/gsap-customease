GSAP CustomEase
===============
Greensock CustomEase port from ActionScript to TypeScript/JavaScript.

Usage
=====
* Import the TypeScript module (or load the JavaScript file through `<script>` tags)
* Create a custom ease [here](http://www.greensock.com/customease/)
* Run the CustomEase and use it in your tweens or timelines

Notes
=====
Using CustomEase in the GSAP ActionScript library requires a premium
membership but because this package is not available whatsoever in the JavaScript
library, I have decided to port it. If this is not in accordance with the GSAP
licence, please let me know and I will take it down.
